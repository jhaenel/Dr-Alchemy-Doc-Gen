# Dr-Alchemy-Docs
Dr. Alchehmy Docs aims to redefine the way developers approach code documentation by harnessing the power of AI while ensuring the expertise of a human remains central to the process.

# Premise
Even the best of codes can become enigmatic without proper documentation. The objective of CodeCompanion Docs is to ensure that codebases are always accompanied by accessible, transparent, updated, and context-aware comments and documentation.

# Tenants
 - When reading code, read code
 - Keep documentation fresh, without exception
 - Code has a hierarchy, so should documentation
 - Neither humans nor AI can document code well alone

# Roadmap
## v0
  [] Generate a clone of a file with inline comments
  [] Integrate as a VSCode extension
  [] Only regenerate relevant changes
  [] Persist human added comments
  [] Prompt to verify relevant human-added comments are still fresh
## future
  - Create more complex and insightful hierarchies, aggregations, and abstractions
  - Chat about the documentation
  - Generate a docs site
